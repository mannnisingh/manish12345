The `logging` module in Python provides a flexible and configurable framework for emitting log messages from applications. It allows developers to capture and manage various levels of information, from simple debugging messages to critical error alerts.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Monitoring:** In production environments, logging helps monitor the health and behavior of an application. By logging key events, errors, and performance metrics, developers and system administrators can gain insights into the application's runtime behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Troubleshooting:** When an application encounters issues or errors, logs provide valuable information to identify the root cause. Analyzing log files helps developers diagnose problems and make informed decisions about how to address them.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Auditing and Compliance:** Logging is essential for auditing and compliance requirements. It allows organizations to track user activities, security events, and system changes for regulatory purposes.\n",

        "5. **Performance Analysis:** By logging performance-related information, developers can analyze the efficiency of algorithms, identify bottlenecks, and optimize code for better performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Create a Central Logging Configuration:**\n",
        "   Create a central logging configuration in a module that is loaded early in the application's lifecycle. This module can be named, for example, `logging_config.py`.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Import the Logging Configuration in Other Modules:**\n",
        "   In each module or class that requires logging, import the central logging configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # module1.py\n",
        "   import logging\n",
        "   from logging_config import log_format\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Use Loggers with Module Names:**\n",
        "   When creating loggers in each module, use the `__name__` attribute as the logger name. This ensures that loggers have unique names based on their module hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This practice allows you to configure loggers at different levels for specific modules if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Configure Handlers and Formatters as Needed:**\n",
        "   In each module or class, configure additional handlers and formatters if necessary. For example, you might want to direct log messages to different output streams or files.\n",
        "\n",

        "Both logging and print statements in Python are used for displaying information, but they serve different purposes and have distinct features. Here are the key differences between logging and print statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Output Destination:**\n",
        "   - **`print`:** Sends output to the standard output (typically the console).\n",
        "   - **`logging`:** Allows configuration of different output destinations, such as the console, files, network sockets, or external services.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Message Severity Levels:**\n",
        "   - **`print`:** Has no built-in concept of severity levels.\n",
        "   - **`logging`:** Provides log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to indicate the severity of log messages. This allows developers to categorize messages based on their importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Configuration and Flexibility:**\n",
        "   - **`print`:** Offers limited configurability; output cannot be easily redirected or customized.\n",
        "   - **`logging`:** Allows extensive configuration, including the ability to customize log formats, use different handlers, and filter messages based on severity. Logging can be configured centrally, making it easier to manage and control log output across an entire application.\n",

        "4. **Runtime Overhead:**\n",
        "   - **`print`:** Minimal runtime overhead.\n",
        "   - **`logging`:** Introduces a slightly higher runtime overhead due to the flexibility and configurability it provides. However, the overhead is usually negligible for most applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Integration with External Systems:**\n",
        "   - **`print`:** Outputs messages to the console, and capturing or redirecting this output requires additional effort.\n",
        "   - **`logging`:** Offers built-in support for various handlers, making it easier to integrate with external systems, log aggregators, and monitoring tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Information Security:**\n",
        "   - **`print`:** May expose sensitive information, especially in production environments.\n",
        "   - **`logging`:** Can be configured to filter or obfuscate sensitive information in log messages, improving security.\n",
