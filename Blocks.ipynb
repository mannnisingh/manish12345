        "The `try` and `except` blocks in Python are used for handling exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of a program. The primary role of these blocks is to provide a mechanism for graceful handling of errors, preventing the program from terminating unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how the `try` and `except` blocks work:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`try` Block:**\n",
        "   - The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception or encounter an error.\n",
        "   - It's the region where you expect potential errors to occur.\n",
        "   - If an exception occurs within the `try` block, the remaining code in the block is skipped, and the corresponding `except` block is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
        "       result = 10 / 0\n",
        "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "       # Code to handle the exception\n",
        "       print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   this example, the `try` block attempts to perform a division by zero, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. The corresponding `except` block catches this specific exception and executes the code inside it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`except` Block:**\n",
        "   - The `except` block contains the code that should be executed if a specific type of exception occurs in the associated `try` block.\n",
        "   - You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",

        "   ```python\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **`else` Block (Optional):**\n",
        "   - An optional `else` block can be used after the `except` block. The code inside the `else` block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       result = 10 / 2\n",

        "   In this example, since the division is valid (no `ZeroDivisionError`), the `else` block is executed, printing the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`finally` Block (Optional):**\n",
        "   - An optional `finally` block can be used after the `except` (and optionally `else`) blocks. The code inside the `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",

        "\n",
        "b. **FloatingPointError:**\n",
        "   - **Reason:** Raised when a floating-point operation results in an undefined or infinite value, such as division by zero or overflow.\n",
        "   - **Example:** `x = 1.0 / 0.0` or `y = float(\"inf\") - float(\"inf\")`.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. **IndexError:**\n",
        "   - **Reason:** Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range (index is either too large or too small).\n",
        "   - **Example:** Accessing an element in a list using an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "d. **MemoryError:**\n",
        "   - **Reason:** Raised when an operation cannot be completed due to insufficient memory.\n",
        "   - **Example:** Allocating a large amount of memory using `list` or `range` and exceeding system limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "e. **OverflowError:**\n",
        "   - **Reason:** Raised when an arithmetic operation exceeds the limits of the data type.\n",
        "   - **Example:** `x = 2.0 ** 1024` (raising 2 to the power of 1024 may result in overflow).\n",
        "\n",
        "f. **TabError:**\n",
        "   - **Reason:** Raised when inconsistent use of tabs and spaces is detected in indentation.\n",
        "   - **Example:** Mixing tabs and spaces for indentation within the same block.\n",
        "\n",
        "g. **ValueError:**\n",
        "   - **Reason:** Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument of the correct type but an invalid value.\n",
        "   - **Example:** Trying to convert a string to an integer, but the string does not represent a valid integer (`int(\"abc\")`).\n",
